## More Yapping
Hi! I am Ankush Roy a teen from India. I love mathematics and computers. I aspire to become a Graphics Programmer as it consist of all maths, programming and art. I love customising my workstation exactly the way I like, so I use [my own rice](https://github.com/AnkushRoy-code/dotfiles) of Arch Linux (btw) that consist of i3, Polybar, Rofi, Picom. I use Neovim as my editor for everything and have made a [custom config](https://github.com/AnkushRoy-code/dotfiles/tree/main/.config/nvim) from scratch that I use daily. I also use a modified version of Colemak Mod-DH layout in my custom ergonimic split keyboard called [Splitwave](https://github.com/AnkushRoy-code/SplitWave). I live in the terminal and only use my mouse (MX Master 3S) for browsing the web or other very few GUI applications that I use.

Above all I am trying to become a better person who doesn't show off and is humble....I am trying.
